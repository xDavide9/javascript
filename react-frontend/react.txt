react is based on a hierarchy or components that are rendered on the page
the virtualdom which is a lightweight rappresentation of the realdom made by react is used to keep track of the changes in the state of these components so that react can update them automatically
react is just a library that takes care of updating the components when their state changes (and not a framework like angular) and therefore we should rely on other libraries to effectly build a webpage (like boostrap (css library), material ui for already created components, antd still for components)
