in order to test with jest you have to install it 
either globally with npm i -g jest or locally npm i --save-dev jest

then modify the npm test script entry in package.json with "test": "jest"

then you have to create a folder names __tests__ and inside it have your tests
as files ending with .test.js 

then you can run tests in different ways: npm run test, npm test, jest or vscode integrations

something important is that you have to follow the same directory structure when testing

there is a babel plugin and file used to configure jest to use es imports
