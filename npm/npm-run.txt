https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scripts

when you run npm install or npm scripts what is happening behind the scenes
is that there is an entire lifecycle behind each script with pre and post script

now you don't care about those scripts really because they are already defined by npm
and are good to go 

what you care about is the scripts that are specified in the package.json and that can
be run with npm run 

"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  }

this is the defalt scripts entry where you only have one script which does nothing basically
but you can run it with npm run test

you can create your own scripts

"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "foo": "echo \"foo\" && exit 1"
  }

this is the main concept now there are a lot of scripts implemented by libraries like react etc
