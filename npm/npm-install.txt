npm install or npm i is used to install dependencies in your package

npm install --save-dev jest 
will install jest (testing library) to be used in the development of the application

npm install --save react
will install reac (ui library) to be used for running the application

npm install -g eslint
will install the eslint globally in your computer meaning it will be available in every workspace

when using the save options you are saving the dependencies as entries in
the package.json file and also creating a node_modules folder

the node_modules folder contains all the dependencies used by the current package
including the dependencies of the dependencies used (that's why it's big)

if you delete this folder then your application won't run because it cannot resolve the dependencies so
npm install
will just reinstall those dependencies by recreating the node_modules folder

so npm install with save options updates the package.json with those dependencies and also installs them
via the node_modules folder

this is also useful when you clone a repo from github
you will most likely not find the node_modules folder but
the package.json and therefore you can just run npm i to install the dependencies

finally there is the package-lock.json which is autogenerated and should not be edited
it is a file that contains information about what happened while using npm and should
be included in github repositories
